Is there a shift happening in the real estate market? Yes, and here’s why. &nbsp;

First, the number of houses for sale has increased for the first time in three years. As a result, how quickly your home goes up in value might slow down. &nbsp;&nbsp;

According to Mark Fleming, the chief economist at First American, “We’re seeing the first indications that price appreciation may be slowing, but the underlying fundamental housing market conditions support a natural moderation of house prices rather than a sharp decline.”
