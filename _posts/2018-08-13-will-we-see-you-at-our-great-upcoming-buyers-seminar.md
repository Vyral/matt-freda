We’ve got an exciting announcement to make today: You’re invited to our upcoming buyers seminar! We are holding this event on Wednesday, August 15 between 6:30 p.m. and 7:30 p.m. on the second-floor conference room of the Bentley Architects and Engineer Building (651 W. Warren Ave. Longwood). The tips and tricks we’ll share at this seminar will be a huge help for first-time homebuyers or for anyone who hasn’t made a home purchase in a while.
