Housing market experts all agree on one thing: Home prices will rise this year\!&nbsp;

At the start of the year, many of them predicted that home price appreciation would decelerate as 2019 progressed. However, with the first half of the year coming to an end, experts’ projections have become more aggressive.&nbsp;

Now, **Freddie Mac predicts prices will rise by 3.6% and that’s not all: The Home Price Expectation Survey and CoreLogic predict price upticks of 4.3% and 4.8%, respectively. &nbsp;**
