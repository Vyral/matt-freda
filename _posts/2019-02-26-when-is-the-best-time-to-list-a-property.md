People ask us all the time about when the best time to list a property is in Orlando. Many sellers wait until spring to put their houses on the market, but that means more competition. **Most listings come on the market between April and June, which means the sweet spot is between November and February when supply is low.** Don’t follow the crowd. Take advantage of these great conditions now.
