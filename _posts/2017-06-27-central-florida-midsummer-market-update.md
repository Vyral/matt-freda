The stats from the Florida Association of Realtors are hot off the presses so I wanted to give a quick update on the state of the market here.

What's going on here in the Central Florida real estate market?

We just got the most recent stats from the Florida Association of Realtors and **all signs point to our real estate market saying very strong.**

If you're thinking about selling your home, you'll be pleased to hear that the median sales price for homes here is up 7% to $218,00.

If you're looking to buy a home, you're still in good shape with interest rates still hovering around 4%. **It's a great time to either buy or sell a home.**

If you're thinking about making a move or you have any questions about our market, don't hesitate to give me a call or send me an email soon. I'd be happy to help you!
