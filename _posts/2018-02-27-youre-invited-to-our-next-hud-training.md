We’re hosting an upcoming HUD training. We hope you’ll join us.

I’m here to invite you to our next HUD agent training on March 14 from 11:30 a.m. to 1 p.m. It will be held over at the office of our friends at Quality Title & Escrow in their Kissimmee. We will cover the entire process, from build submission all the way through closing. All the questions you wish you had answers to will be answered. We’ll have lunch for you as well.

We’ll have mortgage, title, and real estate experts there to answer all your questions. RSVP by sending an email to info@fredarealtyorlando.com today.

If you have any other questions for us, don’t hesitate to reach out by phone or email. We look forward to hearing from you soon.
