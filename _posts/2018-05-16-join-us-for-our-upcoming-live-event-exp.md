Your home is your biggest financial investment. Whoever you hire to help sell it needs to be qualified for the job.

In the state of Florida, anybody can get their real estate license within a week or two. All you need to do is take a three-day class and sit for a state exam.

**Because the barrier of entry into the business is so low, everybody knows someone around here who has a real estate license.** Maybe it’s a friend, a family member, or a neighbor. This might be the first person you think of when it comes to real estate and you might be ready to hire them on the spot, but you shouldn’t. 

For most of us, our home is our biggest financial investment. You want to be sure you’re putting that asset in the right hands before you hire somebody to do the job. I’ve worked with expired listings a lot and one of the common threads I’ve seen is the fact that most of these people hired an agent who was a friend or family member and didn’t interview anybody else.

At the end of the day, selling your home is a business transaction. If someone isn’t owning up to their responsibility as an agent, you shouldn't hesitate to fire them. **If it’s a good friend or family member that you hire, the hesitation will definitely be there.**

That’s why I think you need to interview at least three different agents for the job of selling your home before you hire one. Interview that friend or family member you know, but also interview somebody who has a proven track record and great reviews online. It will make your ultimate decision a lot easier.

**I’d love to interview for the job of helping you buy or sell a home.** If you have any questions for me or want to know how I can help you achieve your real estate goals, don’t hesitate to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon!
