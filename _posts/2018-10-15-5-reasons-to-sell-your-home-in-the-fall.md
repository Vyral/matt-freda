There are five reasons you should consider selling your home this fall:

1. **Buyer demand is strong.**
2. **There is less competition now.** That means there aren’t enough homes for sale to satisfy the number of buyers in the market.
3. **The process of selling your home will be quicker**. The average time it takes to close a loan is only 44 days.
4. **There may never be a better time to move up**. Over the next year, prices are projected to increase by 5.1%.
5. **It’s time to move on with your life.**

If you have any questions about how to proceed with selling your home, feel free to reach out to me and my team. Let’s get together to discuss your options.
