Today we’ll be discussing positive equity. Let’s find out what percentage of homeowners have it, and how many have seen an increase in it since last year.

What percentage of homes across the US have positive equity?

Recently I saw an article that had some great news about positive equity in our nation’s market.

When I read it, I was happy to discover that roughly **63% of all homeowners have seen an increase in equity within the past year.**

So what does this mean for homeowners—especially those living in our state? Well, 88% of homeowners have positive equity in our properties.

Since 2010, which was the bottom of the barrel in terms of home values, we’ve come quite a long way. **Distressed sales, too, are down over 70%.**

This is also great news, since at one point distressed sales were the only kind of sale existing out there on the market.

If you have any other questions, would like more information, or would like to a free, no-obligation equity report, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
