We’re hosting an event this December that will teach you how to successfully close and sell HUD homes.

You are officially invited to our upcoming Realtor HUD lunch-and-learn training session.

At this event, we’ll cover all the details from the contract-to-close process. It will take place on December 7 from 11:30 a.m. to 1 p.m. at 665 West Warren Avenue, Longwood, Florida 32750.
