Thanksgiving is just around the corner, and you know what that means— it’s pie time again! Today we want to give you a quick reminder that you still have time to reach out to us and reserve your complimentary pumpkin or apple pie. If you haven’t received your postcard in the mail already, just remember that the deadline to make your reservation is November 16. We’d love the opportunity to help you celebrate the holiday season and introduce you to our amazing team of co-sponsors: Champion Title & Closing. To see our full message, watch this short video.
