Today we’ll be going on a quick tour around the office, introducing you to key members of teamFREDA.

We’re here at our office in Longwood today, and we wanted to give you a quick tour to show you exactly how our team is structured.

On this tour, we will introduce you to:

◘ **Karen Sierra, our listing coordinator.** Karen works with the sellers to help them create the best marketing campaign to get their property sold. She also manages the REO (real estate owned), bank-owned, and HUD (housing and urban development) properties, with the same goal of marketing them to sell.

◘ **Cory**, our inside sales agent who works with expired listings and FBSOs. Cory books appointments for the listing specialist, as well as fielding calls to the sink database—the database of buyers that registered on our website, looking for information.

◘ **Tara, our buyer specialist.** Today, she’s calling all past clients that we’re trying to schedule showings for who we haven’t been able to, as well as reaching out to those who’ve emailed her previously looking for additional information on search criteria for a particular home.

◘ **Matthew**, one of our team leaders. Matthew talks a little bit about how each team member fits into the mold at teamFREDA.

◘ **Traci McCain**, our director of development and training. Traci helps design and implement the training processes, as well as with mentoring and training the new agents. As a Realtor herself, she also prospects and works her own deals. Additionally, she oversees and manages all transactions. When a client goes from contract to close, we take that workload off the agent’s plate.

For the full tour, watch the video above.

If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give us a call or send us an email. We look forward to hearing from you soon.
